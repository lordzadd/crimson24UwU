Abode was created to be a easy home management solution for new buyers. After being deprecated without a release by the original company after going under with over 6,500 followers on tiktok we have tried to bring it back.

We thought it would be helpful to new homeowners to have a tool to help remind them what parts of a house need to be maintained and how frequently.
To be useful, we wanted to allow the user to create a custom profile so that the reccomendations would be relevant to their home, because no two homes are alike. 
Each home can have a different number of rooms and different kinds of rooms. The program also allows homeowners to have multiple houses in case they need reminders for more than one property.
